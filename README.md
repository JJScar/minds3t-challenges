# 🛠 Minds3t Challenges

## 💻 Welcome to the Minds3t Challenge Repository

This repository contains all the challenges for Minds3t, a cyberpunk-style Web3 learning experience. Your mission? Complete development tasks, exploit vulnerabilities, and prove your skills.

💡 Everything runs on Foundry—a powerful smart contract development and testing framework. If you haven’t set it up yet, follow the instructions below.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 📌 1️⃣ Install Foundry
You need Foundry to compile, test, and run the challenges. If you don’t have it yet, install it going to the [foundry book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) docs and follow their instructions. 

### 📌 2️⃣ Clone This Repository
Once Foundry is installed, clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Minds3t-Challenges.git
cd Minds3t-Challenges
```

### 📌 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
Use the Makefile to get all necessary dependencies:
```bash
make build
```

## 📜 Challenge Structure
Each challenge follows a consistent format inside the /src/ directory and the coding solution also in the test/ directory:
```
/src/
    ├── challenge1/
    │   ├── Contract.sol        # The dev task contract 
    │   ├── Exploit.sol         # The hack task contract 
    │   ├── README.md           # Challenge instructions
/test/
    ├── challenge1/
    |   ├── Challenge1.t.sol    # The Forge test file
```

## 🧪 Running Challenges
To test if your solution is correct, navigate to a challenge folder, and follow the README.md instructions.
